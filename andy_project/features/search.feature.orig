Feature: Checking that  go to the search function displays the correct pages
  As a user
  I want to enter a search term and for the correct car details to be displayed


@javascript
Scenario: Searching for Fords from the car buyer home page
    Given I am on "/"
    When I fill in "edit-keys" with "Ford"
    And I press "Search"
    Then I should see "Search found"
